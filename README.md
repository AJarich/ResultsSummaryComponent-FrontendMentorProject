# Frontend Mentor - Results Summary Component Exercise

This is my solution to the Results Summary Component on Front End Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV).

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge is to make the Results Summary Component as close to the images as possible. The component is going to be responsive, with a different look
for both desktop and mobile. The button should change color when hovered over, too;

## My Process

### Built With

-- HTML5
-- CSS3
-- Flexbox
-- CSS Grid
-- Google Fonts

### What I Learned

I was able to practice using the flexbox in this project. I used flexbox in many situation. It helped me when the component changed from a horizontal row in
desktop to a vertical column in mobile. The flexbox also came in handy for the mini containers that contained the scores and icons. Using "jusify-content: space-between"
in CSS helped to make it so that the icon was on one side and the score on the other side.

I also got practice on using the linear-gradient with the score circle.

### Continued Development

In the future, I would want to try to use React.js to create this, especially with printing the scores from data.json.
